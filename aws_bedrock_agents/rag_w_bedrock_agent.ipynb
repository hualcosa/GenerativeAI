It implements a technique known as gradient boosting on trees, which performs remarkably well in machine learning competitions.   Amazon SageMaker supports two ways to use the XGBoost algorithm:    \\\\tXGBoost built-in algorithm   \\\\tXGBoost open source algorithm           The XGBoost open source algorithm provides the following benefits over the built-in algorithm:   \\\\tLatest version - The open source XGBoost algorithm typically supports a more recent version of XGBoost. To see the XGBoost version that is currently supported, see XGBoost SageMaker Estimators and Models.   \\\\tFlexibility - Take advantage of the full range of XGBoost functionality, such as cross-validation support. You can add custom pre- and post-processing logic and run additional code after training.    </content>    <source>        3    </source></search_result><search_result>    <content>        Flexibility - Take advantage of the full range of XGBoost functionality, such as cross-validation support. You can add custom pre- and post-processing logic and run additional code after training.   \\\\tScalability - The XGBoost open source algorithm has a more efficient implementation of distributed training, which enables it to scale out to more instances and reduce out-of-memory errors.   \\\\tExtensibility - Because the open source XGBoost container is open source, you can extend the container to install additional libraries and change the version of XGBoost that the container uses. For an example notebook that shows how to extend SageMaker containers, see Extending our PyTorch containers.       Use XGBoost as a Built-in Algortihm\\u00b6   Amazon SageMaker provides XGBoost as a built-in algorithm that you can use like other built-in algorithms. Using the built-in algorithm version of XGBoost is simpler than using the open source version, because you don\\\\u2019t have to write a training script. If you don\\\\u2019t need the features and flexibility of open source XGBoost, consider using the built-in version. For information about using the Amazon SageMaker XGBoost built-in algorithm, see XGBoost Algorithm in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.       Use the Open Source XGBoost Algorithm\\u00b6   If you want the flexibility and additional features that it provides, use the SageMaker open source XGBoost algorithm.   For which XGBoost versions are supported, see the AWS documentation.    </content>    <source>        4    </source></search_result><search_result>    <content>        Multi-model endpoints are supported in SageMaker XGBoost versions 0.90-2, 1.0-1, and later. For information about using multiple XGBoost models with multi-model endpoints, see Host Multiple Models with Multi-Model Endpoints in the AWS documentation. For a sample notebook that uses Amazon SageMaker to deploy multiple XGBoost models to an endpoint, see the Multi-Model Endpoint XGBoost Sample Notebook.
